            >If I use your music, will I get flagged for copyright on YouTube or
            elsewhere?</strong
          >
        </h4>
        Nope! The music isn't registered for mechanical collection anywhere. If
        you do get flagged, someone other than me has registered the music as
        their own. Bad person. Please let me know if you find a bad person.
        <h4>

        </h4>
        Short answer: probably. View the above chart to double-check. The music
        is all <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>.
        If it says 'ONLY WITH CREDIT', then you have to add this link to the
        description of your video or podcast: Music by John Bartmann

        </h4>
        Yes. Check the chart above for usage scenarios.

            >Do I need to ask permission to use your music in my commercial
            projects?</strong
          >
        </h4>
        No. But you have credit me. If you can't credit me, purchase a license.
        View the chart above. Here's a <a href="/ratecard.pdf">ratecard</a> for
        all usage scenarios.
        <h4><strong>What is the license type of your music?</strong></h4>
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
          >Creative Commons CC-BY</a
        > license. <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a> if you're unsure about
        what that means.
        <h4>
          <strong>Do you own the rights to reproduce this music? </strong>
        </h4>
        Yes. I've done some Christmas stuff, but other than that, I am the 100%
        sound recording and compositional rights holder. everything else was
        either written and recorded by me or someone I've hired.
        <h4><strong>Can I monetize my YouTube videos?</strong></h4>
        Yes.
        <h4><strong>Can I resell your music?</strong></h4>
        No. It's terrible karma. All tracks have their own ISRC numbers (digital
        fingerprints), so I am able to prove that I'm the original author.
